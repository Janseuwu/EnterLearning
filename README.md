# EnterLearning

EnterLearning is a browser extension for ItsLearning, that adds various features to the site,
such as enabling the use of "Enter" under class search. For a full list of features see [Features](#Features)

## Installation

#### Chrome
The extension for Chrome can be found on the [Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enterlearning/mkhcjdopceldkjggmefcikdckkobkonc?hl=da).

#### Firefox
The extension for Firefox can be found on [Mozilla's Add-on site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enterlearning/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search).

The Firefox version is known to have issues, due to some host permission issues Firefox has yet to resolve.
This can be solved by manually giving the addon the needed permissions. 

To do so, follow these simple steps:
* Go to [about:addons](about:addons)
* Locate and select the EnterLearning extension
* Go to the `permissions` tab and switch on the "Access your data for sites in the `*://itslearning.com` domain".

That's it! The extension should now be fully functional.
