# EnterLearning

EnterLearning is a browser extension for ItsLearning, that allows the user to
search for classes using the "Enter" key.

## Installation

First, clone the repo with `git clone`. Afterwards, follow the installation
instructions for your browser. The `src/` directory contains everything needed
for the extension including assets and manifest.

### Chrome installation

- Open chrome
- Click on the three dots in the top right corner
- More tools > Extensions
- Enable developer mode in the top right corner
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Select the cloned "chrome" directory

The extension is now installed and ready to use.

### Firefox installation

We are currently waiting for a signature, which is required by Firefox for permanent
installation. You can, however, install it temporarily using the `web-ext` tool
or the `about:debugging` page.

## Todo

- Fix the errors it gives (it still works :D)
- Sign the Firefox extension.
